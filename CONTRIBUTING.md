# Contributing to Tank Time Capsule

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Tank Time Capsule as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## 📝 Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the FEATURES.md if you've implemented a new feature
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## 🐛 Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## 💻 Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## 🧪 Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test across different browsers
- Test both light and dark themes

## 📚 Documentation

- Update documentation for new features
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document any new environment variables

## 🔄 Version Control

- Make small, focused commits
- Write clear commit messages
